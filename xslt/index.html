<h1>XSL: Extensible Stylesheet Language</h1>
<p>XSL is a language, or a set of languages used together, applicable when working with XML documents. It is used to describe how XML documents should be displayed. If you are familiar with using CSS to describe how HTML documents should be displayed, XSL plays a similar role for XML.</p>

<p>There are multiple parts of XSL, and this crash course will deal with two of them:

<ul>
<li>XSLT: The "T" stands for transformation, and we use XSLT to transform XML documents. You can output a different XML document, plain text, or even no document at all using XSLT.</li>
<li>XPath: Use XPath for navigating XML documents. If you think of an XML document as a tree, XPath is how you reference elements (nodes, leafs) on your tree.</li>
<li>XQuery: Use XQuery when you want to query XML documents, similarly to how you might query a relational db using SQL. It is not covered in this crash course.</li>
